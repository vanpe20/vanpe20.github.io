Hello, I am Zeru, a first year Ph.D. student in Rutgers University. I am honored to be guided by Prof.[**Ruixiang Tang**](https://www.ruixiangtang.net/). I will receive my BE degree in Software Engineering at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/)

<!-- Before, I was an intern in [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/)'s laboratory at Rutgers University. -->

My research interests mainly focus on:
-  **AI interpretability**: I aim to leverage interpretability analysis of LLMs and VLMs to identify lightweight, efficient, and training-free methods that can generally enhance their performance.
-  **LLM/VLM Reasoning**:  I am highly interested in reasoning within LLMs and VLMs. My work explores post-training methods, such as reinforcement learning–based optimization, as well as training-free approaches to improve their reasoning capabilities.
-  **LLM-based Multi-Agent System**: I am especially interested in the memory mechanisms of LLM-based agent systems.

  
Meanwhil, I've got a bunch of hobbies, likes soccer, traditional Chinese calligraphy, traveling and mixing drinks. By the way I am a big Manchester United fan.
