Hello, I am Zeru, a senior majoring in Software Engineering at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/) in ISE. My research interests mainly focus on Machine Learning systems, Trustworthy Machine Learning, Generative Artificial Intelligence(MultiModel) and LLM-based Agents.

At present, I am an intern in [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/)'s laboratory at Rutgers University, and I am also an intern in [**Shanghai AI laboratory**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)(Pujiang laboratory)

At the beginning of my academic career, under the guidance of [**Prof.Risheng Liu**](https://rsliu.tech/) from Dalian University of Technology, I mainly focused on Low-Level Computer Vision. This research experience greatly enriched my research background. Then I followed [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/) to focus on Large Language Models and Machine Learning systems. With the help of two different backgrounds, I finally entered [**Shanghai AI laboratory**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), where I mainly focus on vllm and Generative AI

In order to continue to pursue my academic career, I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the fall of 2020. My rich research background gives me a wide range of interests and provides strong theoretical support for my research. At the same time, I have enough enthusiasm to pursue more meaningful work.

Meanwhil, I've got a bunch of hobbies, likes soccer, traditional Chinese calligraphy, traveling and mixing drinks. By the way I am a big Manchester United fan.
