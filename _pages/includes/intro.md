Hello, I am Zeru, a senior majoring in Software Engineering at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/) in ISE. I'm going to Rutgers University to pursue my PhD degree and I am honored to be guided by Prof.[**Ruixiang Tang**](https://www.ruixiangtang.net/). My research interests mainly focus on AI interpretability and leveraging interpretability to improve model performance, LLM Reasoning, and Vision Language Action(VLA).

Before, I was an intern in [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/)'s laboratory at Rutgers University.
 <!-- and I am also an intern in [**Shanghai AI laboratory**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)(Pujiang laboratory) -->

At the beginning of my academic career, under the guidance of [**Prof.Risheng Liu**](https://rsliu.tech/) from Dalian University of Technology, I mainly focused on Low-Level Computer Vision. This research experience greatly enriched my research background. Then I followed [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/) to focus on Large Language Models and Machine Learning systems. With the help of two different backgrounds.
 <!-- finally entered [**Shanghai AI laboratory**](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), where I mainly focus on vllm and Generative AI -->

Meanwhil, I've got a bunch of hobbies, likes soccer, traditional Chinese calligraphy, traveling and mixing drinks. By the way I am a big Manchester United fan.
