Hello, I am Zeru, a senior majoring in Software Engineering at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/) in ISE. I'm going to Rutgers University to pursue my PhD degree and I am honored to be guided by Prof.[**Ruixiang Tang**](https://www.ruixiangtang.net/). I will receive my BE degree in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology

<!-- Before, I was an intern in [**Prof.Yongfeng Zhang**](https://yongfeng.me/)'s laboratory at Rutgers University. -->

My research interests mainly focus on:
-  **AI interpretability**: I hope that through the interpretability method of LLM, we can understand and analyze the reasons for the decisions made by LLM, and thus improve the performance of LLM in performing tasks.
-  **LLM Reasoning**:  I am very interested in LLM reasoning, especially the reasoning of mathematical problems. I hope to improve the accuracy of the chain of thought and answers generated by LLM when performing reasoning problems.
-  **LLM-based Multi-Agent System**: I hope to learn from OS methods to build efficient and human-friendly LLM Agent systems.

Meanwhil, I've got a bunch of hobbies, likes soccer, traditional Chinese calligraphy, traveling and mixing drinks. By the way I am a big Manchester United fan.
